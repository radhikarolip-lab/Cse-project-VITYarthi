# Problem Statement

Managing student records manually is time-consuming, less efficient, and prone to errors.  
Maintaining information such as roll number, name, branch, and marks becomes difficult when handled on paper or simple registers. Searching, updating, or deleting a specific student record also requires extra time and effort in a manual system.

Therefore, there is a need for a simple computerized system that can store, manage, and retrieve student information easily and accurately. 
This project aims to solve this problem where data is stored in a structured format using a JSON file. The system provides a user-friendly menu-based interface and performs operations efficiently with data persistence.
